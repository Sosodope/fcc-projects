			<h3>The genius who

				Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is still the predominant electrical system used across
				the world today. Nikola Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's
				interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in
				her spare time while her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer,
				and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.

				<p>If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw
					after straw until he found the object of his search... I was a sorry witness of such doings, knowing that a little theory
					and calculation would have saved him ninety per cent of his labor.</p>
